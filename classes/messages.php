It is encouraged to use different coding for these answers for two reasons (in general Other=99 and unknown=98). <p>You can easily add additional choices without needing to recode your values When you are using statistical software it is apparent which values correspond to special codes, For example, the following is NOT recommended: </p><ul class="list-group" style=" padding-left: 50px; width: 250px; "><li class="list-group-item">1, Dr. Jones</li><li class="list-group-item">2, Dr. Parker </li><li class="list-group-item">3, Dr. Smith</li><li class="list-group-item">4, Other </li></ul><p>Say you have collected data for 100 records and you now want to add Dr. Rose to the list. A common mistake is the following: </p><ul class="list-group" style=" padding-left: 50px; width: 250px; "><li class="list-group-item">1, Dr. Jones</li><li class="list-group-item">2, Dr. Parker </li><li class="list-group-item">3, Dr. Smith</li><li class="list-group-item">4, Dr. Rose <strong>(DON\'T DO IT THIS WAY)</strong></li><li class="list-group-item">5, Other</li></ul><p>If, before the change, you had 20 records as \'other\' with a value of 4, they would all instantly be transferred to Dr. Rose. This usually isn\'t what is intended. A better design is something like: </p><ul class="list-group" style=" padding-left: 50px; width: 250px; "><li class="list-group-item">1, Dr. Jones</li><li class="list-group-item">2, Dr. Parker </li><li class="list-group-item">3, Dr. Smith</li><li class="list-group-item">99, Other</li></ul><p>Now you can add additional members to the list during the project without needing to recode.
